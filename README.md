# ecobots
Fork of DokimiCU's ecobots from the self_organizing_sytems modpack.
License: LGPL v2.1+


# Changes

Custom dig_node function that doesn't drop items when turning them into air so that objects don't get spammed everywhere.

Eusocial Bots are no longer limited to savannahs, spawn mostly everywhere and consume all plants from the flora group.
